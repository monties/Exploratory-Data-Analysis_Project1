# Exploratory-Data-Analysis_Project1
this is the first project for the course of Exploratory Data Analysis

In this repository, you will find 4 R sctipts and the related outcome plots.
The used data set is “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which is from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The raw dataset contains measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
This plotting project is taking data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

<li>Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
<li>Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
<li>Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
<li>Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
<li>Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
<li>Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
<li>Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
<li>Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
<li>Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
